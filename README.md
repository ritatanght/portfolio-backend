# Rita Tang's Portfolio

Welcome to the repository of my portfolio website! This repository contains the source code for the back-end of my personal portfolio website. Additionally, the `public` folder holds the build from the front-end, allowing hosting of the full-stack app directly from this repository. To access the source code for the front-end portion of the website, please refer to the [portfolio frontend repository](https://github.com/ritatanght/portfolio-frontend).

**Projects**
- Browse through a collection of my recent projects, each demonstrating various aspects of web development, including front-end design and back-end functionality. 
- Utilize Express and MongoDB to retrieve project data. A POST route has also been implemented for easy database updates with new projects.
